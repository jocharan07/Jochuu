Hi, I'm  G.Jyothicharan, a passionate DevOps enthusiast and aspiring cloud engineer. I love building efficient CI/CD pipelines, automating workflows, and visualizing complex systems to make development smoother and smarter.

Currently exploring tools like diagrams.net to represent lifecycle stages and improve team collaboration. I'm also diving into GitHub projects to sharpen my version control and deployment skills.

Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together!
